##  Installation Guide (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Install Docker (The "Container" for the Software)

Docker is a tool that runs the software in an isolated environment. You only need to install it once.

#### For Windows:

1. **Download Docker Desktop:**
   - Go to [docker.com/get-started](https://docker.com/get-started)
   - Click "Download for Windows"
   - File size: ~500MB (may take 5-10 minutes to download)

2. **Install Docker Desktop:**
   - Double-click the downloaded file
   - Follow the installation wizard (click "Next" → "Next" → "Install")
   - Restart your computer when prompted

3. **Verify It's Working:**
   - Look for a whale icon in your system tray (bottom-right corner)
   - If you see it, Docker is running! 

**Troubleshooting:** If Docker doesn't start, you may need to enable virtualization in your BIOS. [See detailed guide here](#troubleshooting-docker-wont-start-on-windows)

#### For Mac:

1. **Download Docker Desktop:**
   - Go to [docker.com/get-started](https://docker.com/get-started)
   - Click "Download for Mac"
   - Choose "Mac with Intel chip" or "Mac with Apple chip" (M1/M2)

2. **Install Docker Desktop:**
   - Open the downloaded `.dmg` file
   - Drag Docker to your Applications folder
   - Open Docker from Applications

3. **Verify It's Working:**
   - Look for a whale icon in your menu bar (top-right)
   - If you see it, Docker is running! 

#### For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):

1. **Open Terminal** (Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`)

2. **Run These Commands** (copy and paste one at a time):

```bash
# Download Docker installation script
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh

# Run the installation script
sudo sh get-docker.sh

# Add your user to the docker group (so you don't need sudo)
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Install Docker Compose
sudo apt install docker-compose -y
```

3. **Restart Your Computer**

4. **Verify It's Working:**
```bash
docker --version
```
You should see something like "Docker version 24.0.6"

---

### Step 2: Get Your OpenAI API Key

OpenAI is the company that provides the AI (GPT-4) that creates your content.

**Think of the API key like a password** that lets this program use OpenAI's AI.

#### Detailed Steps:

1. **Create an OpenAI Account:**
   - Go to [platform.openai.com/signup](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
   - Sign up with your email
   - Verify your email address

2. **Add Billing Information:**
   - Go to [platform.openai.com/account/billing](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing)
   - Click "Add payment method"
   - Add a credit card
   - **Add $20 credit** (this will generate ~600-700 pieces of content)

3. **Create an API Key:**
   - Go to [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Click "Create new secret key"
   - **IMPORTANT:** Copy the key immediately! It starts with `sk-`
   - Save it in a safe place (you can't see it again)

**Example API Key:** `sk-proj-abc123XYZ...` (yours will be longer)

** Pro Tip:** Set up a spending limit in OpenAI's billing settings to prevent unexpected charges.

---

### Step 3: Download SPLANTS Marketing Engine

You need to get the software files onto your computer.

#### Option A: Using Git (Recommended)

**What is Git?** A tool for downloading and managing code.

1. **Install Git:**
   - **Windows:** Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)
   - **Mac:** Open Terminal and type `git --version` (it will install automatically)
   - **Linux:** `sudo apt install git`

2. **Download SPLANTS:**
```bash
# Open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows)
cd Desktop
git clone [repository URL].git
cd SPLANTS
```

#### Option B: Download ZIP (Easier)

1. Go to [[repository URL]]([repository URL])
2. Click the green "Code" button
3. Click "Download ZIP"
4. Extract the ZIP file to your Desktop
5. Rename the folder to `SPLANTS`

---

##  First-Time Setup

Now you'll configure the system with your API keys.

### Step 1: Create Your Configuration File

The system needs to know your API keys and preferences.

1. **Find the `.env.example` file** in the SPLANTS folder

2. **Make a copy and rename it:**
   - **Windows:** Right-click → Copy → Rename to `.env`
   - **Mac/Linux:** In Terminal:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Open `.env` in your text editor**

### Step 2: Add Your API Keys

You need to edit two important lines:

**Find this line:**
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here
```

**Replace with your actual key:**
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-abc123XYZ...
```

**Find this line:**
```
API_KEY=change-this-to-a-secure-password-123
```

**Replace with a strong password** (this protects your system from unauthorized use):
```
API_KEY=MySecure!Password789
```

** Password Tips:**
- At least 12 characters
- Mix of letters, numbers, and symbols
- Don't use common words
- Example: `Biz2024!Market#Ai`

### Step 3: Set Your Budget (Optional but Recommended)

To prevent surprise charges, set a spending limit:

**Find this line:**
```
MONTHLY_AI_BUDGET=50
```

**This means:**
- The system will stop generating content if costs reach $50/month
- You won't accidentally overspend
- You can adjust this anytime

**Recommended budgets:**
- **Light use (50-100 pieces/month):** $30
- **Medium use (200-300 pieces/month):** $50
- **Heavy use (500+ pieces/month):** $100

### Step 4: Save the File

- **Windows:** File → Save (or Ctrl+S)
- **Mac:** File → Save (or Cmd+S)
- **Linux:** Ctrl+O, then Enter

---

##  Starting the System

### First Time Launch

1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt** in the SPLANTS folder:
   - **Windows:** Right-click in the folder → "Open in Terminal" or "Open Command Prompt here"
   - **Mac:** Right-click folder → Services → "New Terminal at Folder"
   - **Linux:** Right-click → "Open in Terminal"

2. **Run the quick-start script:**

```bash
# Make the script executable (Mac/Linux only)
chmod +x scripts_quick-start.sh

# Run the script
./scripts_quick-start.sh
```

**For Windows (if the script doesn't work):**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. **Wait 30-60 seconds** for everything to start

4. **Check if it's running:**

Open your web browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8080

### Method 3: Using Your Own Code (For Developers)

**Python Example:**
```python
import requests

# Your configuration
API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"  # From your .env file
BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8080"

# Make a request
response = requests.post(
    f"{BASE_URL}/v1/generate",
    headers={
        "X-API-Key": API_KEY,
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    json={
        "content_type": "blog",
        "topic": "10 Marketing Tips for Small Business",
        "keywords": ["marketing", "small business", "tips"],
        "tone": "professional",
        "length": 800
    }
)

# Get the result
content = response.json()
print(f"Quality Score: {content['quality_score']}")
print(f"Content: {content['content']}")
```

**JavaScript Example:**
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const API_KEY = 'your-api-key-here';
const BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:8080';

async function generateContent() {
  const response = await axios.post(
    `${BASE_URL}/v1/generate`,
    {
      content_type: 'blog',
      topic: '10 Marketing Tips for Small Business',
      keywords: ['marketing', 'small business', 'tips'],
      tone: 'professional',
      length: 800
    },
    {
      headers: {
        'X-API-Key': API_KEY,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    }
  );

  console.log('Quality Score:', response.data.quality_score);
  console.log('Content:', response.data.content);
}

generateContent();
```

### Problem: Port 8080 already in use

**Symptoms:**
- Error: "Port 8080 is already in use"

**Solution:**

**Option 1: Use a different port**

Edit `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
ports:
  - "8081:8080"  # Change 8080 to 8081 (or any free port)
```

Then access at `http://localhost:8081`

**Option 2: Stop the other service using port 8080**

**Windows:**
```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :8080
taskkill /PID [PID_NUMBER] /F
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
lsof -i :8080
kill -9 [PID]
```

```json
{
  "length": 500  // instead of 2000
}
```

2. **Don't use premium mode unless needed:**
```json
{
  "use_premium": false
}
```

3. **Check your internet connection**

4. **Check OpenAI status:**
   - Go to [status.openai.com](https://status.openai.com)
   - Check if there are outages

##  Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Do I need to know how to code?**
**A:** No! You can use the web interface at `http://localhost:8080/docs` to do everything. No coding required.

**Q: Is this legal to use for my business?**
**A:** Yes! OpenAI grants you full rights to content generated through their API. You own the content.

**Q: Can I use this for client work?**
**A:** Absolutely! Many agencies use this to serve multiple clients efficiently.

**Q: Is my content private?**
**A:** Yes! Everything is stored in your private database. OpenAI doesn't train on API content.

**Q: Can multiple people use the same system?**
**A:** Yes, but you'll need to manage access through your API_KEY. Everyone can share the same installation.

---

### Technical Questions

**Q: What happens if I run out of OpenAI credit?**
**A:** Content generation will fail with an error message. Just add more credit to your OpenAI account.

**Q: Can I run this on a free server?**
**A:** Most free servers don't have enough resources. You need at least 2GB RAM and persistent storage.

**Q: How do I update to the latest version?**
**A:** 
```bash
git pull
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

**Q: Can I change the AI model?**
**A:** Yes! Edit `main.py` and change `gpt-4-turbo-preview` to another model like `gpt-3.5-turbo` (cheaper but lower quality).

**Q: How do I run this on the internet (not just localhost)?**
**A:** You need to deploy to a server. See `docs_DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed instructions.

---

### Cost Questions

**Q: What if OpenAI raises prices?**
**A:** You can switch to alternative AI providers (Claude, Gemini, etc.). The system supports multiple providers.

**Q: How can I reduce costs?**
**A:**
1. Enable Redis caching (-30-50%)
2. Use shorter content
3. Set monthly budgets
4. Use GPT-3.5 instead of GPT-4 (much cheaper, lower quality)

**Q: What's the cheapest way to run this?**
**A:**
- Use your computer (free server)
- GPT-3.5-turbo ($10-15/month)
- No Redis ($0)
- **Total: ~$10-20/month**

**Q: What's the most powerful setup?**
**A:**
- VPS server ($15/month)
- GPT-4 + Claude multi-model ($50/month AI)
- Redis caching ($10/month)
- **Total: ~$75/month**

---

### Usage Questions

**Q: How long does content generation take?**
**A:** Usually 10-30 seconds per piece. Longer content takes more time.

**Q: Can I generate content in other languages?**
**A:** Yes! Just specify the language in your topic or add a note:
```json
{
  "topic": "Schreiben Sie einen Blogpost über KI-Marketing (German)"
}
```

**Q: Can I customize the writing style?**
**A:** Yes! Use the `tone` parameter and add detailed instructions in your `topic`.

**Q: How many pieces can I generate per day?**
**A:** As many as you want! Limited only by:
- Your `DAILY_API_LIMIT` setting
- Your OpenAI credit
- Your budget

**Q: Can this schedule posts for me?**
**A:** The system prepares content and can schedule it, but actually posting requires platform API keys (optional feature).

### Troubleshooting Questions

**Q: What if I made a mistake in the .env file?**
**A:**
1. Edit the .env file
2. Save it
3. Run: `docker-compose restart app`

**Q: How do I see error messages?**
**A:**
```bash
docker-compose logs -f app
```

**Q: Can I reset everything and start fresh?**
**A:**
```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
```
 This deletes all content!

**Q: Where are my generated contents stored?**
**A:** In the PostgreSQL database. To export:
```bash
docker-compose exec db pg_dump -U splants splants > export.sql
```
